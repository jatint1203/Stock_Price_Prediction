      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-3">We are a passionate team of students as investor. Earlier, we always faced problems
          while doing equity analysis in our personal capacity. Most Free stock screeners available either provided
          insufficient data or were plagued with inaccuracy.<br>
          The paid tools on the other hand, were way too expensive for the common man. We aim to make
          investing simple & rewarding for the retail investor. Hence, we took matters in our own hand to build an
          enterprise grade research & analysis tool for the retail investor and came up with this project.</p>
